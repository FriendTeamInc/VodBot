VodBot is command line VOD and Clip manager for Twitch. Vodbot can:
* Grab info on any public VOD, Clip, or Channel on Twitch.
* Queue and download any available VOD or Clip from Twitch, along with useful metadata and chatlogs.
* Slice and splice videos downloaded in instances of staged data.
* Export instances one at a time or all at once, with chatlogs converted to common formats such as RealText or SAMI.
* Upload instances one at a time or all at once to YouTube, with chatlogs as captions/subtitles synced with the video.
	* NOTE: Requires approval and credentials from Google, for now just use export and upload manually.

...with more features to come!

## Project Status
VodBot is considered complete-enough. However, features will continue to be added and the project itself rewritten many times down the road for optimization and repo readability. Major changes should not be expected. Any future releases will be documented on the [projects page](https://github.com/NotQuiteApex/VodBot/projects).

# License and Credit
This project is licensed under the zlib license, copyright Logan "NotQuiteApex" Hickok-Dickson. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for more details.

VodBot was built on the grounds laid by the streaming group Friend Team Inc. (for the original idea and necessity of the project), the many people who research Twitch's GraphQL API (for all the API calls that the project makes), and the support from friends and family (for, y'know, the support). Without any of this, VodBot would not exist as it currently does. ðŸ§¡
